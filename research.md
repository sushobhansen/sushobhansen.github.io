## Interests
My area of interest is urban studies, bringing together tools from a variety of disciplines to solve the problems of the world's cities. For this, I apply skills from pavement engineering, heat transfer, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and mesoscale meteorology. Currently, I study the relationship between pavement materials, urban form, and urban microclimate - popularly known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect.

<h3 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#multifunc">Multi-Functional Concrete Inlays for Pavement Preservation <span class="label label-info">Completed</span></h3>
<div id="multifunc" class="collapse">
<p>As the transportation infrastructure in the US continues to age and funding for reconstruction diminishes, preservation offers a method to deploy resources to extend the service life of existing pavements. Moreover, it also serves as an opportunity to improve the sustainability of existing pavements, such as through using recycled materials, or improving the use-phase characteristics.</p>
<p>In this project, we looked at using thin, fiber-reinforced concrete inlays over existing asphalt pavements to improve their functional capacity. In addition, we used white cement incorporated with titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) to mitigate the Urban Heat Island (UHI) by increasing the albedo of the pavement surface, and removing near-road air pollutants (NOx, SOx, and VOCs) through a photocatalytic reaction. We found that these inlays improve the surface characteristics of pavements without adding significant structural capacity, while also reducing the Radiative Forcing (RF) and converting pollutants to relatively less harmful byproducts.</p>

<h3 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#psat">Development of a Pavement Preservation Sustainability Assessment Tool <span class="label label-default">Ongoing</span></h3>
<div id="psat" class="collapse">
<p>Pavement Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a quantitative tool to measure the sustainability of pavements. In an LCA, the life cycle of a pavement is divided into materials, construction, use, maintenance, and end-of-life phases, and the environmental impact in each phase is accounted for. Currently, there is no tool that performs an LCA for pavement preservation techniques, using both asphalt and concrete treatments.</p>
<p>In this project, a team from the <a href="http://ict.illinois.edu" target="_blank">Illinois Center for Transportation</a> is working to build a user-friendly, Excel-based tool to quantify the LCA for several preservation treatments, including chip seals, thin overlays, crack sealing, etc. As part of this tool, the use phase impact will take into account rolling resistance, texture, and Urban Heat Island (UHI) impact. In particular, the quantification of UHI will take into account differences in albedo and construction location.</p>

<h3 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#thermaloptic">Thermal and Optical Characterization of Pavement Materials <span class="label label-default">Ongoing</span></h3>
<div id="thermaloptic" class="collapse">
<p>For the characterization of the impact of pavement materials on local urban microclimate, the first step is to characterize the materials themselves. There are two types of characteristics that are of interest: optical characteristics, which determine how much energy is admitted into the pavement (absorptivity, or one minus albedo) and how much is emitted (the emissivity); and thermal characteristics, which determine how much energy is conducted through the pavement layers (thermal conductivity) and how much is stored for a given increase in temperature (heat capacity).</p>
<p> In this project, the thermal and optical properties of both asphalt and concrete specimens is being determined. Specifically, albedo is characterized in the laboratory using a spectrophotometer, while thermal properties are characterized using a rapid, lab-based Transient Plane Source (TPS) technique. For concrete specimens, a statistically-controlled predictive model will be developed, while for asphalt specimens, field cores will be used. For both cases, a general range of values will be obtained and compared to values currently used in Mechanistic-Empirical pavement design.</p>

<h3 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#canyoncfd">Pavement-Urban Canyon CFD Model for Urban Blocks <span class="label label-default">Ongoing</span></h3>
<div id="canyoncfd" class="collapse">
<p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been used in the past to characterize the flow of wind in urban areas. A few jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands, have developed building codes that require designers to account for pedestrian wind comfort, which can be done through wind tunnel testing or CFD. Fewer studies have considered the effect of building and road configurations on the local microclimate. Research has shown that in urban canyons, the usual ventilation of air becomes constricted, leading to warm air stagnating and increasing local air temperatures.</p>
<p>In this project, a pavement thermal model is being used together with a 3D CFD model of an urban area. Using a Boussinesq approximation for speed, the wind flow and temperature fields are resolved using a turbulence closure model in order to investigate what pavement strategies can mitigate the heat island in various parts of the city effectively. The study includes a grid convergence investigation, validation, and directional sensitivity analysis. The open-source CFD tool <a href="https://openfoam.org/" target="_blank">OpenFOAM</a> is used.</p>

<h3 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#autonomousveh">Autonomous Vehicles for Higher-Order Thinking in a Geometric Design Class  <span class="label label-info">Completed</span></h3>
<div id="autonomousveh" class="collapse">
<p>Autonomous vehicles, popularly called self-driving cars, have been the focus of research for several years, and have recently caught the attention of policymakers. Most of the transportation engineering-related literature concerning autonomous vehicles revolves around travel pattern and demand forecasting with very little focus has been placed on understanding how the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles may change pavement geometric design. Given the expected widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, it becomes crucial to understand and train students on potential changes in geometric design in the future. </p>
<p>Using a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach, the CEE 415 Geometric Design of Roads class will be asked to modify existing geometric design standards from AASHTO to incorporate elements of fully autonomous vehicles. This approach is expected to allow students to critically analyze the standards and prepare them to tackle future challenges. The key outcomes that will be measured through this exercise are critical thinking skills, transferrable skills, and self-perception of the level of learning. </p>
