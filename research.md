## Interests
My interests lie in computational and data-enabled modeling of infrastructure, with a particular focus on the interaction between infrastructure and the environment in urban areas.

		<td>Efficient linear viscoelastic modeling of asphalt pavements</td>
		<td>Development of an efficient numerical scheme and tool to decompose the linear viscoelastic behavior of asphalt pavements into a series of equivalent linear elastic problems. This allows for quick evaluation of the time-dependent response of flexible pavements, with particular focus on over-sized an slow-moving loads such as Implements of Husbandry (IoH) and Superloads (SLs).</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Local cool surfaces in urban neighborhoods</td>
		<td>Effectiveness of applying cool surfaces to only a part of the area within an urban neighborhood, and comparing its benefit relative to cost with that of applying cool surfaces to the entire area. The study also compared various spatial configurations that would maximize benefits relative to cost.</td>
