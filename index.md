## Welcome to my website!
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I love cities: they are the cauldron of human civilization, a living embodiment of our creativity, and the future of humanity. For a researcher, cities represent an almost-endless source of fascinating research questions. My research interests aim towards designing safer, healthier, and smarter cities by bringing the power of modern computational tools to traditional engineering and urban planning.

Currently, I study the effect of roads on outdoor air temperatures in cities. My research combines traditional concepts of pavement engineering with materials characterization, heat transfer, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and informed by an understanding of meteorology. My inter-disciplinary focus while working under my advisor, [Prof. Jeff Roesler](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jroesler), makes me ready to handle the urban challenges of this century. 

Please have a look through my website to know more about what I do. **I am currently a post-prelim Ph.D. candidate, and will be looking for tenure-track faculty positions starting in 2019.**

## In the news
- Thew News-Gazette [interviewed](http://www.news-gazette.com/video/2016-12-23/wired-sushobhan-sen.html) me on some of my research in Dec, 2016
- I will be presenting at the 97th Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board in Washington, DC, in Jan, 2018
