I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, with a PhD in civil engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I love infrastructure: from highways that are hundreds of kilometers long to buildings that soar to the skies, and the vast underground systems that keep both of them running. I am fascinated by the effect of infrastructure on how people live and am excited by research that helps make them better.
