I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, with a PhD in civil engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests are in the field of climate change adaptation of urban infrastructure, with a specific focus on pavements. My skills include experimental thermal and optical characterization of construction materials, computational modeling, and machine learning. <br>I will be starting as an Assistant Professor at [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/) in December, 2022.
